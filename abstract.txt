CEFE NIMBLE Workshop
23-24 October 2019

This workshop provides a hands-on introduction to NIMBLE, an R package for performing statistical analyses.  NIMBLE provides a flexible system for MCMC, and other algorithms which operate on hierarchical models.  This workshop will introduce the NIMBLE system, demonstrate creating and operating statistical models in NIMBLE, fitting models to data using MCMC, modifying MCMC algorithms to achieve improved sampling performance, and extending the modeling syntax with user-defined distributions and user-defined functions.  The workshop involves a hands-on lab component, and presents a variety of ecological models and data sets as motivational examples.
