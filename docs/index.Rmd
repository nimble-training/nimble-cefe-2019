### Welcome to the CEFE NIMBLE Workshop

Over the next two days, you'll get an introduction to the `nimble` package for R, including it's use for MCMC, and other statistical algorithms.

We'll also discuss the closely related `nimbleEcology` package, designed specifically for common ecological model structures.
